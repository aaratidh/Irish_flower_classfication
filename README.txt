Irish Flower Classification Using Tensoflow in Anconda

Steps 1: 
	Importing and installing necassary libaraies 

Step 2: Reading the data 

step 3: Visualizing data: 
        Scatter plot: 
        For visualization of the dataset I have used scatter plot which is always fascinating.
        The intresting thing about scatter plot is it allow us to show the distribution of three different class of the species in a single figure.
        Scatter plot makes it easier to use different color for different types of species Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica in a single graph.
        I have used REd blue green for respective color.
        
 	Pair plot: 
        This is another important weapon for visualization of the data. It helps to identify the best set of the variable to classify the data. 
	Most of the times the model for the classification can be achived by simple set of the linear relation between two features.
        In our case, pair polt clearly specify the we can seperate the cluster simply using petal width on on y-axis and petal length on x-axis.
        But we are heading to mke some use of tenswaor flow so we leave if potential if else model behind.

                

Step 5: Data prosessing 

Step 6: Spliting Traning and testing sets 

Step 6: Classifying the dataset 

Step 7: Making conclusion 
        From scatter plot we can see that Iris-setosa had wider sepal than of the versicolor and virginica.
        where as virginica  species has longer sepal length than remaning rest of them. The versicolor  species turn out to be of average of the both with and length.
